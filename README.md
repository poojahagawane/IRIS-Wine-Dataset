# IRIS-Wine-Dataset
IMPLEMENTATION OF PCA AND LDA


Abstract
This project implements the Big Data dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA and
machine learning techniques like LDA. Here these techniques are applied on two different datasets
of iris and wine quality. Two datasets used have different dimensions as well as number of
instances. Experimental results show that PCA works better for data with high dimensions. For
both the datasets used in this project, there is no significant difference if LDA is applied with or
without PCA.
